					<p>By this time of the course, one should have a stable idea of how to invest in the stock market using technical analysis. Also, one should understand how knowing the company they invest and not just a few letters can provide essential value. Lastly, one should understand how to choose a brokerage and get started. The motto I trade by "only invest in an uptrend" can be altered a little. For example, if a stock is approaching a high whether weekly or yearly, holding might not be the best idea. However, when a stock is approaching an all time low, that offers a greater return over risk. This is only true if one understanding the companies numbers and sees value in its future. However, this course is designed for students/full time workers to trade weekly/monthly, so long term investing won't be the idea here. Long term investing offers less risk over time but emotional detachment is always a problem. That's why if one understands how to swing trade/day trade, the individual can learn to detach their emotions.</p>
					
					<p>Now, there are many other strategies to teach, but this strategy is designed for those who have full time jobs, are students, or really for anyone with not a lot of time on their hands. I'm sure a lot of us know how important it is to have multiple streams of income. So, making an extra $200 a week or $100 every two weeks can help ease the pressure of those annoying bills. However, the best lessons learned are the hardest hits. Every day thousands of stock will be pitched but strikes will alone happen when one decides to swing. So, during those red days always remember it’s just part of the process. Work hard, work smart and work consistent!</p>
					
					<p>Here is my top 8 most important tips when investing in the stock market:</p>
					
					<ul>
						
						<li>never invest in others opinions;</li>
						<li>let your emotions take the backseat;</li>
						<li>don’t be afraid of cutting loses;</li>
						<li>keep track of trades and outcomes;</li>
						<li>share your failures with others;</li>
						<li>only invest in understandable patterns;</li>
						<li>keep in mind the "REUSES" acronym;</li>
						<li>be patient!</li>
						
					</ul>
					
					<p>Remember, before taking a position always go through these aspects:<br/><b>R</b>esistance;<br/><b>E</b>ntry (buy);<br/><b>U</b>ptrend;<br/><b>S</b>upport;<br/><b>E</b>xit (sell);<br/><b>S</b>top loss.</p>
					
					<ul>
						
						<li>Have you identified a Resistance?</li>
						<li>Have you identified a Entry?</li>
						<li>Is the trend an Uptrend?</li>
						<li>Have you identified a Support?</li>
						<li>Have you identified an Exit?</li>
						<li>Have you identified a Stop loss?</li>
						
					</ul>
					
					<p>If any of these questions answer with a no, reconsider the trade!</p>
