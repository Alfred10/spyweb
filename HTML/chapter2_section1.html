				<h1>Understanding Big Picture Trading</h1>
				
				<div id = "div0">
					
					<p>When talking about <b>big picture</b>, we are really talking about analyzing charts on larger time frames. See, many beginner traders will just look for short term gains, and therefore plan small picture trades. This is a very poor way to go about it. It's like investing in a company if you can only see 10% of its spreadsheets. </p>
					
					<p>When I learned about big picture trading and waiting for these big picture setups, overall, my trades started to become more profitable. This should make sense; I was planning ahead of time and basing these setups off at least a six-month chart (more data).</p>
					
					<p>When you are only looking at a small time frame, you will miss very large setups. Similar to how when we look up at the sky, we don’t see the entire milky way. I would often get stuck in trades or stopped out for reasons that weren't clear.  However, when I realized it was because I missed a large support/resistance, it was very eye opening. So, how exactly do we plan a big picture trade?</p>
					
					<p>The whole idea of this chapter is to give a better understanding of analysis on charts. So, as you would assume, we begin with a chart. We want to mark off levels of resistance and support as we mentioned in the first chapter. Remember, old resistance levels are current support levels and old support levels are current resistance levels. Even though we are day trading, marking off large pictures will only benefit us.</p>
					
					<p>I usually start by marking off levels on the three year chart, depending on the IPO, and the chart of the company. I would then go to the yearly chart then keep narrowing down to 6 month, 1 month then smaller time frames. I don't always go exactly in that order of time frames, but that’s the idea of this strategy. Areas to mark off are support, resistance, and consolidation levels. If you are not sure about how to identify all of those areas, refer back to Chapter 1's section on support and resistance levels. As you we already discussed, the time frame of that level is very important. I prefer marking off levels in the color red for levels over 3 years. This helps me when I am trading and I can clearly see the larger, more important levels. Also, marking off these levels can help to minimize your risk. Think about it, if you used larger time frames, you would get a way better understanding with less fluctuations and less risk. If you're looking at 1m charts, your going to see a bunch of levels, candles, and patterns that can potentially confuse you. You can mark these levels off, but it's better to focus on the big picture trades.</p>
					
					<p>Below is a short video I created discussing how to mark off big picture levels!</p>

					<p>When all of these levels are marked off, you can then further your analysis with patterns.</p>
					
				</div>
				
				<h1>Patterns</h1>
				
				<div id = "div1">
					
					<p>Now that you have big picture levels marked off, you can now focus on the patterns that are formed. Patterns, in technical analysis, are basically formations that have a specific result. When these patterns are studied, it's very easy to play these because they only have a certain number of outcomes. Consequently, they can be very profitable with little risk, if the trader knows the possible outcomes. So, let's go over the most common patterns.</p>
					
					<p><u>Wedge:</u><br/>A <b>wedge</b> pattern is the combination of a support and resistance level. These levels must be inversely sloped to form a wedge. So, if the resistance is descending, the support must be ascending to form a wedge or else it's just a range. Also, one of these levels can be horizontal, but the other must be ascending or descending to be considered a wedge. These are my favorite patterns to play just because they are so simple, but yet so rewarding at the same time.</p>
					
					<p>The result of the wedge pattern is either a break to the upside or the downside. However, the most important aspect to realize for this pattern is to wait for confirmation. This is something that I went over in Chapter 1 and I can't emphasize this concept more. The confirmation factor of this wedge is after the breakout. For example, if the candles decided to break to the downside, meaning it breaks the support, you don't enter there. Remember that old support levels are current reistestane levels, thus this previous support will now be a resistance. So, basically, when the candles break under the support, wait for them to retest that resistance. If that retest fails (rejects that level and moves lower), then there is a confirmation to get short. If the stock breaks to the upside and moves higher, wait for the confirmation that the resistance is now a support to enter a long bias trade.</p>
					
					<center><img id = "image0" src = "../IMG/C2S1/image0.png" alt = "wedge"></center>
					
					<p><u>The Double Bottom and Double Top:</u><br/>The next pattern is the <b>double bottom</b> and/or <b>double top</b>. These are very simple patterns but yet offer a great opportunity for profit. These are patterns in which the stock rejected the same price two consecutive times, forming either the letter "M", or the letter, "W". Basically, if a stock is approaching a resistance and gets rejected off that price, and then retested that price and rejects again, you will noticed that the area will have a lot of sellers. In this case, the stock is not likely to move past that area, and, instead, is more likely to move lower from that area. Same with the inverse side of the support: as the stock tests that support and bounces then retests and bounces again, there are heavy buyers. Here, there is a fairly large chance of the stock moving higher and not breaking that support to the downside. These patterns can bounce more than two times, and sometimes even three or four times. Just understand that the more times it fails to break that level, the smaller the chance of it actually breaking it.</p>
					
					<p>Also, when these patterns are formed and you decide to take a position, you have a great setup for your entry, exit, and stop loss points. For the double top, you can take a short bias trade by putting your entry at the resistance, a stop loss above the resistance, and an exit at or around the support. For the double bottom, you can take a long bais trade right above the support, a stop loss below the support, and a target exit at or around the resistance. Basically, the double bottom is a significant pattern to understand and has a great margin of profit when fully understood. It's important to note that it will never always look picture perfect. Always wait for confirmation through other signs like volume and key levels.</p>

					<center><img id = "image2" src = "../IMG/C2S1/image2.png" alt = "double bottom"></center>
					
					<p><u>The Head and Shoulder Pattern:</u><br/>This is also a very important pattern to understand, and really quite simple. The <b>head and shoulder</b> pattern is a three peak pattern that usually results in the downside move. In this pattern, we see a stock rise and retract back forming the first shoulder. Then a larger peak is formed showing the head followed by the second shoulder, forming the head and shoulder pattern. As that last shoulder is descending, the pattern usually results in a break to the downside, breaking the support past all lows of the pattern. Both shoulders are approximately equal in height with a higher peak in between, giving the illusion of an actually human’s head and shoulders. So, as the second shoulder reaches the support, the pattern usually breaks the support to the next support lower, depending on the chart. In other words, as it approaches the previous low of the first shoulder, the first blue circle, it moves lower past the second blue circle. It's a very simple pattern when understood and consistently played. Also, the head and shoulders pattern can also appear inversely, in other words, upside down.</p>
					
					<p>This pattern is not as common as the rest, but when it forms, especially on big picture, the downside move could be quite massive. Notice how in both pictures, when it comes down after the second shoulder, it either retests that blue circle or consolidates before moving even lower. That is the desired entry because that is confirming its weakness, thus moving lower. It can always meet the blue circle and move higher into new highs. That's why waiting for the confirmation is very important, especially on the head and shoulders pattern.</p>
					
					<center><img id = "image3" src = "../IMG/C2S1/image3.png" alt = "head and shoulder pattern"></center>
					
					<p>There are many other patterns that appear when trading the technicals, so you can learn them by simply researching the others. These are just the most common ones that I see in my everyday trading.</p>
					
					<p>When trading patterns, make sure:</p>
					
					<ul>
						
						<li>it confirms the trend;</li>
						<li>you understand your target exit;</li>
						<li>you have the patience to wait for the entry;</li>
						<li>you set your stop loss once you enter the position.</li>
						
					</ul>
					
					<p>At this point of the course, you should be able to further develop your strategy by understanding patterns and key level breakouts. You should then be able to use this strategy by utilizing my techniques for determining stop loss, exit and entry points.</p>
					
					<p>Below is a short video discussing these patterns.</p>
