					<h1>Biggest Loss</h1>
					
					<p>Starting off, I would like to share my biggest loss ever and how handled it. This was an earnings play, I went over this term briefly in the first chapter. In general, every company goes through quarterly  earnings and when this occurs, the company will either hit or miss their target, resulting in a massive move in the stock. Now in my eyes, how can a company like Twitter go down 30%? The morning after the earnings, twitter dropped 20% and I thought this was a dip buy. Well, it continued to fall stopping me out down 8% on the trade. I was very ignorant, uneducated, filled with emotions, and just not in the correct mindset. This was my second month trading. After this loss, I went back to the drawing board and made sure I was only trading setups I knew after a confirmation. I anticipated the stock to move higher which is a horrible way to trade. This showed me that anything can happen and never try to predict the bottom or top. Again, never try to predict the bottom or top, you will always lose!</p>
					
					<p>As you can see, the ETF I broke down above, was a live and real stock analysis. The next morning, the ETF worked out perfectly. This shows if you have a strategy and you fully analyze a chart with a confirmation, you can be profitable. Granted this will not be the outcome every time but we are really just trying to minimize our risk and maximize our reward.</p>

					<h1>Biggest Gain</h1>
					
					<p>My biggest win was a short play on a penny stock, $GERN. This penny stock gapped up 100% with non-credible news and was far above the mean price. As a result, I shorted in the around 4.40 and covered 3 weeks later around 2.23. This was a setup with a combination of fundamentals and technicals aspects. Trading penny stocks is very difficult and requires massive amounts of analysis and emotional control. I don't teach them often because of the high risk they give and it's better to develop a strong trading strategy with reliable companies first rather than jumping into excessive volatility in penny stocks.</p>
					
					<p>Lesson learned here was have patience. I was down over 20% on this trade but I knew my risk and my reward. I stuck to the plan and ended the trade up over 140%. Remember that you don't lose money until you close the position. Always stick to your plan, just because a stock goes down, doesn't mean you sell. Obviously this is very situational based but this was a problem I had. Bag holding is holding a loss with hope that you make money. Please don't do this! Make a plan and always stick with it!</p>
					
					<p>Notice my biggest win vs my biggest loss ratio. That's approximately a 1:8 ratio for biggest trades. As you can see, from my largest trades to my common positions, I always understand what I'm risking for any amount of reward.</p>

					<h1>Developing your own Strategy</h1>
					
					<p>You may notice I haven't discussed any indicators in this section. The reason is that I like to have an empty chart and mark off my key levels first. Then I like to add SMA/EMA and VWAP afterwards. This will give me a deeper understanding. However, clearly the step-by-step plan worked out perfectly without any indicator. I just wanted to show its not necessary to have them, they will just assist you in the process. To learn more about the indicators, check out Chapter 1.</p>
					
					<p>The largest concepts when trading is controlling your emotions including patience and developing your personal strategy. See, the way I learned was by grasping small concepts that I preferred from others and created a strategy for myself. That's why I explained trading with indicators and without them so you can personally use all these techniques to develop your plan. I will say this forever and ever, "I will rather lose than win on others terms". In trading, this means I would rather lose based on my plan that winning a trade by copying someone else's plan. There is nothing good about this and it doesn't further you as a trader. Always stick with your plan so when you do take a loss on it, you can fix that hole and keep building your strategy!</p>
