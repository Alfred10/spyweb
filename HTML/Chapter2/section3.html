					<h1>Step-by-Step Example of Entry, Exit, and Stop Loss</h1>
					
					<p>To further expand your understanding of technicals, below is a step by step example of how I begin my analysis.</p>
					
					<p><u>Step 1:</u><br/>Find a company/ETF with signs of an uptrend of consolidation phase. In this case, I'm breaking down the S&amp;P 500 index ETF, $SPY.</p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter2/Section3/image0.png" alt = "step 1 chart"></center>
					
					<p><u>Step 2:</u><br/>Mark off big picture key levels including support and resistance levels. I will begin with 180d time frame then move to an hourly chart. Remember I said to use different colors if it helps you. All gray dotted lines I now know are all 180d levels.</p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter2/Section3/image1.png" alt = "step 2 chart"></center>
					
					<p><u>Step 3:</u><br/>Move to a narrower time frame for a more recent chart understanding movement since we are day trading. I'm going to move to a 1hr chart with blue solid lines. As you can see, the 180d lines are till true up to recent. That's why it's important to mark these levels off. The blue lines represent key levels appearing on the 1hr time frame.</p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter2/Section3/image2.png" alt = "step 3 chart"></center>
					
					<p><u>Step 4:</u><br/>Now that we have all levels marked off, let's now look for any patterns. From what I can see, I see an ascending pattern, close to an ascending wedge. I will now mark off the pattern in a green solid line, so everything is all color coordinated and in sync.</p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter2/Section3/image3.png" alt = "step 4 chart"></center>
					
					<p><u>Step 5:</u><br/>We now have all levels marked off, and all patterns identified. Now I'm looking for a strategy here. We can see the candles are currently at the resistance of the green lines. So my plan is if the candles continue to reject the top green line, I will short, or bet against, the $SPY down to the bottom green line/gray dotted line, very simple. The yellow line is the range I will be looking to short and the yellow circle is my target exit.</p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter2/Section3/image4.png" alt = "step 5 chart"></center>
					
					<p><u>Step 6:</u><br/>Now that I have all levels marked off, a pattern identified, and a strategy, all that is left is to determine my 3 numbers, exit, entry, and stop loss. If I think this stock ETF will continue to go lower, I can enter as the top green fails to move higher, roughly at $266.50. I can set my stop loss right above that green line at roughly $267. My exit can be at the yellow circle, approx. $262.50. Thus Iâ€™m risking $0.50 for $4.00 reward or 1:8 risk:reward.</p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter2/Section3/image5.png" alt = "step 6 chart"></center>
					
					<p><u>Step 7:</u><br/>If you read Chapter 1, you would know I had an acronym for every trade I take. I use "REUSES" before every trade and make sure that each question is answer, so let's go through them.</p>
					
					<p><i>Have you identified a <b>R</b>esistance?</i><br/>Yes, top green ascending line and top gray line.</p>
					<p><i>Have you identified a <b>E</b>ntry?</i><br/>Yes, at the top green line at $266.50.</p>
					<p><i>Is the trend an <b>U</b>ptrend?</i><br/>Yes, this trend is making overall higher low points and higher high points.</p>
					<p><i>Have you identified a <b>S</b>upport?</i><br/>Yes, the bottom green line and bottom gray line.</p>
					<p><i>Have you identified an <b>E</b>xit?</i><br/>Yes, at next support lower at $262.50.</p>
					<p><i>Have you identified a <b>S</b>top loss?</i><br/>Yes, right above green resistance line at $267.00.</p>
					
					<p><u>Result:</u><br/>As you can see, my analysis was correct and the trade worked out perfectly to the cent! This occured in real time and happened the day after my analysis above!</p>
