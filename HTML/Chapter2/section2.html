					<h1>Determining the Three Numbers</h1>
					
					<p>Now that you have marked off the big picture levels and determined a pattern, if one is formed, you can now determine the numbers. If you have read Chapter 1, which I highly recommend, you will know you should always have three numbers in mind: entry, exit, and stop loss. I didn't discuss this in detail in the last chapter, so, here, I will discuss how to determine these levels effectively, according to your risk:reward ratio.</p>
					
					<p>First, it all begins with the pattern that you see. Your entry should produce a greater reward to your exit but less risk to your stop loss. In other words, your reward should always be greater than you risk. Once again, your reward should always be greater than your risk. It makes no sense to take a trade with a higher possibility to lose money, correct? Your entry for a trade should always be after a confirmed trend. For example, if a stock breaks a resistance, then retests it and holds as support, that is a great entry for a long bais trade. On the flip side, if a stock broke a support and retested as resistance, that is a good time for short entry. Like I’ve always said, previous resistance levels are current support levels and previous support levels are current resistance levels. So, when a stock does this, it confirms the trend, and will most likely move in that direction. Always remember there will be risk in every trade you take, nothing is 100%. So in this scenario, your entry will be right after the stock bounces off of the support, your exit will be at the next overhead resistance and your stop loss will simply be below the support. All entries exits and stop losses will all depend on the key levels you drawn out and the patterns that you are trading.</p>
					
					<p>In general, a stop loss is set to protect your downside from any major movements. For example, if an individual is trading a highly volatile penny stock moving over 10%  in 5min, their risk is massive. If this individual wants to risk 4% on this trade, his stop loss will be set 4% from his average price. Thus, if the stock sinks, he won't lose more than 4%, in most cases. Now, there are times with halts or massive drops, that there aren’t any buyers for your shares your selling but they are uncommon if you don't trade shady companies. But understand that your stop loss should be based on the chart and your risk/reward ratio only. If your stop loss doesn't share both of those aspects, you will be in a shaky error. High risk occurs when you set your stop loss based on only the chart as well as setting your stop loss only based on your risk/reward ratio. Think about it from the previous example, if your stop loss is set at 4% and a stock is moving 10% in minutes, chances are it can hit your stop loss but move higher because of the lack on chart analysis.</p>
					
					<p>There are many examples of where to put your exit, entry and stop loss, I simply can't go over all of them. For patterns, I recommend setting a stop loss below the level that is being played, put the exit at the next key level in the direction of the trade. Your entry should be right after the pattern is confirmed and, thus, the trade is confirmed. To help eliminate risk involved, try to only take a position after a confirmed trend or pattern.</p>
					
					<p>As an example, let's look at the chart below.</p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter2/Section2/image0.png" alt = "chart"></center>
					
					<p>So, based on this analysis, an entry can be at the retest (last red circle on top), an exit can be an next overhead resistance (horizontal gray line above top white line), and a stop loss can be right below the support (previous resistance). Clearly, if an individual would have traded this, it would have worked out perfectly. Notice how I mentioned not to get in at the break of the resistance. The reason was there was no confirmation that was a support. Until there is, the stock is just floating above a resistance which is a horrible place to let your money sit.</p>
					
					<p>I think many can easily over complicate trading and make it seem as if your learning a new language. If you actually read through chapter 1, thoroughly understood everything, and practiced it, you should be very comfortable with this chapter. You should already have an idea of a strategy and now with chapter 2, you should understand technicals and executions a bit more deeper.</p>
