					<h1>Brokerages</h1>
					
					<p>When getting started, there are many avenues one can take for brokerages. A brokerage is pretty much the middleman for you executing the trade. There are a wide variety of brokerages so some will have their pros and cons.</p>
					
					<p>Picking a brokerage all depends on your goals. Whether you want to trade short term, invest long term, trade penny stocks, for just starting out, I suggest making a TD Ameritrade account. I firmly believe they are the best brokerage for beginners. From their platform ThinkorSwim, to their customer service, TD Ameritrade is a go-to for many. As one develops, and as their interests change, they can find the right brokerage for them, such as TradeZero, TastyWorks, or Fidelity, for example.</p>
					
					<p>As per just recently, there were commissions with most brokerages per trade you take. However, after the blastoff of Robinhood, the first free trading out, demand began to overwhelm and thus, other brokers got involved. So, most brokerages have commission free trading for stocks and ETFs currently. But I still suggest doubling checking commissions have some still charge a commission for options or the futures market.</p>
					
					<p>Below is a list of my personal favorite brokerages as of 1/20 in the U.S:</p>
					
					<ul>
						
						<li>TD Ameritrade</li>
						<li>Fidelity</li>
						<li>Charles Schwab</li>
						<li>Robinhood</li>
						<li>TradeZero</li>
						<li>TradeStation</li>
						<li>E*Trade</li>
						<li>Interactive Brokers</li>
						<li>TastyWorks</li>
						
					</ul>

					<h1>Important Terms</h1>
					
					<ul>
						
						<li><b>Settlement</b> is the period one has to wait until their funds are settled to reinvest them. For example, if Jimmy bought stock $ABC for $1 and sold for $2, that $2 has to settle for 2-3 business days depending on the broker, before reinvesting.</li>
						<li><b>PDT rule</b> allows only 3 day trades in a sliding 5 day period. For example, buying and selling a stock in the same day is one day trade. Doing such action more than 3 times in a 5 day period will result in consequences.</li>
						<li><b>After hours trading</b> is the ability to trade stocks after the market has closed for a select number of hours.</li>
						<li><b>Ask/Bid</b> prices are equivalent to Buy/Sell prices.</li>
						
					</ul>

					<h1>Simulation Trading</h1>
					
					<p>The markets haven't been this accessible to new traders. Being able to trade for free is an amazing opportunity. However, many beginners will over trade as it's not their money and they got nothing to lose, right?. Well no, the whole idea of simulation trading is to give one the ability to practice their strategy without risk. So, if ones strategy is to take 20 trades a day then that's fine but most successful traders will trade a percentage of that number. Simulation trading is basically trading with fake money. This is an awesome way one can trade the live stock market but without their capital. In my opinion, TD Ameritrade has the best simulation trading program. I suggest simulation trading for at least 3 months to prove consistent growth. Only through percentage growth and not dollar amounts will result in better success. It will be tempting to invest with real money but mistakes will appear more often as beginners tend to be more impatient. However,trading with real money will strengthen emotional control and teach the importance of patience. Additionally, keeping a record of your trades and percentage growth is important to identify your mistakes during this period. TD Ameritrade has an amazing platform called thinkorswim. This platform is most popular because of its amazing analysis tools. Here are links to set up your free thinkorswim account.</p>

						<h3><u>Account Information:</u></h3>
						
						<p>One has to be at least 18 years old to create any brokerage account. However, custodial accounts allow one under the minimum age to invest under their parents' consent. Donâ€™t worry parents, your child can't invest with real money unless there is money in that account. Additionally, several accounts exist such as individual, IRA and roth IRA. These accounts offer different details, so it's best to take time and research. Due diligence is important here as many opinions often screw decisions around choosing accounts. I recommend TD Ameritrade through my experience but there are many brokerages to choose from.</p>
