					<h1>Brokerages</h1>
					
					<p>To get started in the stock market, one needs a broker's account. A brokerage is basically the middle man to buy and sell stocks for you. Some brokerages include Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, and Robinhood. However, most brokerages charge a commission of upwards of $7 per trade. However, brokerages that offer free commissions include Robinhood and Webull. Below is a chart I created displaying the most important aspects to consider when chosing a broker.</p>

					<p>Clearly, both free brokerages have there pros and cons. However, before investing, the best way to practice is with simulation trading.</p>

					<h1>Important Terms</h1>
					
					<ul>
						
						<li><b>Settlement</b> is the period one has to wait until their funds are settled to reinvest them. For example, if Jimmy bought stock $ABC for $1 and sold for $2, that $2 has to settle for 2-3 business days depending on the broker, before reinvesting.</li>
						<li><b>PDT rule</b> allows only 3 day trades in a sliding 5 day period. For example, buying and selling a stock in the same day is one day trade. Doing such action more than 3 times in a 5 day period will result in consequences.</li>
						<li><b>After hours trading</b> is the ability to trade stocks after the market has closed for a select number of hours.</li>
						<li><b>Ask/Bid</b> prices are equivalent to Buy/Sell prices.</li>
						
					</ul>

					<h1>Simulation Trading</h1>
					
					<p>The markets haven't been this accessible to new traders. Being able to trade for free is an amazing opportunity. However, many beginners will over trade as it's not their money and they got nothing to lose, right?. Well no, the whole idea of simulation trading is to give one the ability to practice their strategy without risk. So, if ones strategy is to take 20 trades a day then that's fine but most successful traders will trade a percentage of that number. Simulation trading is basically trading with fake money. This is an awesome way one can trade the live stock market but without their capital. In my opinion, TD Ameritrade has the best simulation trading program. I suggest simulation trading for at least 3 months to prove consistent growth. Only through percentage growth and not dollar amounts will result in better success. It will be tempting to invest with real money but mistakes will appear more often as beginners tend to be more impatient. However,trading with real money will strengthen emotional control and teach the importance of patience. Additionally, keeping a record of your trades and percentage growth is important to identify your mistakes during this period. TD Ameritrade has an amazing platform called thinkorswim. This platform is most popular because of its amazing analysis tools. Here are links to set up your free thinkorswim account.</p>

						<h3><u>Account Information:</u></h3>
						
						<p>One has to be at least 18 years old to create any brokerage account. However, custodial accounts allow one under the minimum age to invest under their parents' consent. Donâ€™t worry parents, your child can't invest with real money unless there is money in that account. Additionally, several accounts exist such as individual, IRA and roth IRA. These accounts offer different details, so it's best to take time and research. Due diligence is important here as many opinions often screw decisions around choosing accounts. I recommend TD Ameritrade through my experience but there are many brokerages to choose from. These brokerages will charge a commission but are easily negotiable.</p>
