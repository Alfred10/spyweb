					<h1>What Are Cookies?</h1>
					
					<p>Cookies, also called HTTP cookies, are small sets of data created by a website and stored on a user's local machine in the form of text files. Cookies can be used to store website-related information, such as a user's ID, a user's preferences, or maybe even a user's shopping cart for an online store. Another use for cookies, which may seem controversial to many, is to track people's activity on the websites they visit. This is typically done to gather data on website traffic and to improve online advertising.</p>
