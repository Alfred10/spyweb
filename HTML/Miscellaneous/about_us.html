					<p>My name is Joseph Friia, I'm 18 years old, I'm from NY and attend Pace University, NYC. I've been live trading stocks for a little over a year now. However, I've been trading with simulation since I was 16. I know, I'm very young and don't know everything. But that's the beauty of trading. I'm simply sharing my thoughts through my experience and it's your responsibility to decide to use my content or not. I've learned from individuals from all aspects of the spectrum, from YouTube to professional standings.</p>
					
					<p>I've caught on very fast to concepts of financial assets, specifically stocks and thus became profitable very early on. As I continued to develop my strategy, there was always the aspect of helping others that was there.</p>
					
					<p>So, I created seven social medias giving out free daily content to help others trade the stock market. I quickly realized all the information to trade stocks can be found on the internet. So, I wanted to create a free course that was in the terms of the average Joe, and that's how SPYweb.online was created. I will never charge for any information I give it out. There would be no difference between me and the other guy if we both charged for our courses. This is just the beginning of SPYweb!</p>
					
					<p>Nowadays, I've helped many individuals better their strategies. Also, I've helped others get started in the market. Everything I do is for ZERO charge besides my time. Time is the only asset that is not refundable. This is me.</p>
