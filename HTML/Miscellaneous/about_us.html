					<p>I began trading in my senior year of high school based on the movie, "The Big Short". I started learning from various internet sites, social media and books. My journey was very bumpy at first and still has its rough patches. But as my interests became more clear and my education began of more value, I started learning from professionals. Soon, my preferred educators were professional trading firms, former traders, and sharp retail traders. This is when my trading began to take off in terms of perspective and what actually works. I plan to continue my journey into professional trading firms. Once my interest shifted from making a lot of money to actually learning to trade, I began to learn from the correct sources. That's me and my journey thus far.</p>

					<p>I created SPYweb in the intention to hopefully have a better site to learn about trading U.S. equities. The way I structured this site is by having the user learn as I do and experience everything that I am. More specifically, the greater lessons I learn as the chapters develop. This allows the user to understand the concepts more as many sites are not as beginner friendly. I experienced this often when I was learning in school. I would ask someone with exceeding knowledge of a subject a question, and it would be so difficult to understand. Solely because they often twist more complex ideas and make it more challenging.</p>
