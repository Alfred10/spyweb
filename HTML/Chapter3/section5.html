					<h1>Conclusion</h1>
					
					<p>This chapter is an important chapter to understand. The first two chapters covers the basic technicals you need to understand to begin to trade. Chapter 3 discusses some technicals to add on to but ultimately brings concepts to mind with your trading.  This isn't discussed a lot in the trading industry so it's very important to fully understand what was said here. A lot of trading success doesn't go into the executions themselves. It goes into the transparency and self awareness with developing your style of trading.</p>
					
					<p>What I've found is you learn through building up your process. The constant reviews, adjustments and rules will only advance your trading. Also, trading is recognized as a mirror of your daily life. If you can't follow a daily plan to wake up, go to the gym, exercise,  meditate, etc.  on a specified regimen, what makes you think you can follow a trading plan. As time goes on, and your experience with trading develops, this will begin to show more truth. I hope everyone reading this realizes the reality of trading through this education. Read carefully, print out the PDF and have fun with it!</p>
