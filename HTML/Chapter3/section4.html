					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					
					<p>This section is going to be more targeted towards trading mid/large cap stocks. There are thousands of ways of day trading but this is going to include concepts and ways I've seen to be more profitable than others. I'm not saying this will 2x your account, but will say this is will advance your trading in some way. There will be a PDF at the end of the chapter giving you a simple checklist when taking the trade. There isn't enough time to go over everything so you can build ideas off of these.</p>

					<h1>Opportunity Plays</h1>
					
					<p>There are many mid/large cap stocks, companies over a $2 billion market cap, to filter through. It's important to play the ones that have a higher RVOL. We discussed this in the penny stock section and it plays the same concept. Trading a stock that is having above average volume, meaning a more traders trading that stock than usual, gives you more opportunity. When there is no substantial RVOL or  news, the stock will move slower and not move the way you believe it will. So making sure the stock has either earnings, a strong news, or anything to cause the RVOL to increase, should be in mind.</p>

					<h1>Key Levels</h1>
					
					<p>It might be getting repetitive but that's the reality of trading. If I would be having new strategies and new indicators every time, I will just be lying. Sticking to what you know with trading and mastering that by developing a plan around that is the best way to go, in my opinion. With day trading, key levels include; the major levels, and the minor levels. The minor levels include; prior high-of-day, low-of-day, pre market high/low, gap up levels etc. It depends on each and every stock what levels are more significant than others. Notice the ones that are more significant and focus on those and not every major/minor level. </p>
					
					<p>In this example, I noticed that the major ascending trendline was the level to watch. $BYND is a recent IPO with an extremely high evaluation and with a lot of news on it. Thus, the RVOL will be high. Also, there was an active short sale restriction or, SSR for short. This pretty much helps the stock from collapsing. The short sellers, traders betting this stock will go lower, can't sell the bid or sell when the stock is going down. So, I knew it would be very difficult for this stock to collapse, which benefits long bias traders.. During pre market, it was acting as a support. So, as $BYND came up at the open, I noticed the the ask, where buyers are buying, was failing to get over the trendline. This told me that buyers can't hold up that level. So based on that and the trendline, I took it short there. I exited the position as it got to VWAP, as VWAP is known to be a support for stocks.  It was a very basic trade as that is what I want you guys to realize.</p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section4/image0.png" alt = "day trading key levels example"></center>
					
					<p>Here is another example of a day trade I made. It was an earnings play that gapped off of good earnings. I marked off the levels on the yearly chart. Then, I noticed that the gap up high was acting as a resistance during pre market.  So, my plan was to get long as that 33 level turns into support over VWAP. So the pre market level was now a support, the VWAP was holding, and from the low-of-day, the trendline was ascending.</p>
					
					<p>So, I took the trade to the upside and it worked out great.</p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section4/image1.png" alt = "day trading key levels example"></center>
					
					<p>Clearly, the key levels is very crucial concept to understand with technical analysis. If not, the most important idea to learn. Notice how both charts used seperate levels but the same idea of resistance and support, as discussed in prior chapters.</p>

					<h1>Volume</h1>
					
					<p>Volume is going to be like the pedal to your trades. The more you press down, the faster the trade can potentially move. The less you accelerate, the slower the stock can potentially move. So it's very important to day trade a stock that is having above average volume. If you don't, you will see moves that are slower and more difficult to trade. Wedges won't break nicely, the chart will be all over the place and the strategies here will have a lower success rate. Here are two examples of a high RVOL play versus. a low RVOL.</p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section4/image2.png" alt = "day trading high rvol"></center>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section4/image3.png" alt = "day trading high rvol"></center>
					
					<p>Clearly the chart with a higher average volume has a large move for profit. Now this doesn't say your can't trade a stock below an RVOL of 1. It's just saying the opportunity for a worthwhile move that will react the way you want will be less frequent. So making sure your day trades are in a higher than average volume environment is very important.</p>

					<h1>Managing Risk</h1>
					
					<p>This is a concept that is thrown around a lot with day trading. However, the way the majority of traders view this terminology is very limited, in my opinion. They see the percentage risk they risk based on every trade. That is a part of managing risk but the more significant aspect is your account positioning. You can lose say 3% a trade and "manage it" but if your position sizing is the same across the board, you better hope your winners are over 3%. Sizing up in setups that you statistically perform best in and sizing down in setups you underperform is the better way to consider risk management. This allows you to make more in higher probability trades and cut small losses quickly in lesser quality trades. While also making sure your reward is greater than your risk in all your trades.</p>
					
					<p>This is the reason I will always track and study my past trades. This gives me the ability to size in accordingly. While not tracking my trades positions me with more risk. For example, the setups I perform best in is small cap gappers that have a "red to green" move. So, when I see this setup, and the chart is supporting my thesis, I will size up. Also, mid/large cap stocks breaking a descending trend  at all time highs, or at an ascending trendline, also include my large size. So, keeping track of your best setups should be a priority when reviewing your trades.</p>
					
					<p>Also, when in a trade, don't get greedy. When you take a trade, there should be a scaling out plan. For me, I take profits at every key level. If your in a position, and your making money, and the stock is approaching a level, some of your odds are taken away. So, it's very important to take profit and keep holding unless there is a reason to sell. When you enter a trade, you are exposed to the most risk. So, you should want  to limit risk as your on the correct side of the trade. Sell the position when there is a reason to sell, whether your stop loss gets hit or an inverse confirmation appears. This is discussed more in the PDFs.</p>

					<h1>"The Head of the Snake"</h1>
					
					<p>This is an analogy I often use when discussing trading mid/large caps stocks. What this implies is the use of the head, the index/future, when trading stocks, the body, associated with the ticker. For example, when trading Amazon, you should understand the direction of the S&amp;P 500 index. The reason being that Amazon has such a high market cap that it follows the daily chart of the $spy, SPDR ETF correlated with the S&amp;P 500, very closely. Below is an example of this; the $SPY in purple and $AMZN with the candles. </p>
					
					<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section4/image4.png" alt = "day trading head of snake example"></center>
					
					<p>So, if your looking to trade a large/mid cap, check to see what it trades in and see if there is a daily correlation. In general, the larger the market cap, the more closer it will follow the $SPY.</p>
					
					<p>If your looking to trade leveraged ETFs including; $DGAZ, $UGAZ, $JNUG, $JDST etc, the head of the snake is futures.  I discussed futures in earlier chapters, so if you don't know what a future is, you can go back to chapter 1. Anyways, when trading an ETF following a commodity there is usually a future. For example, the future for gold is $/GC, the future for oil is $/CL and the future for silver is $/CI. So making  sure you understand the futures direction and analyzing the chart, is very important.</p>
					
					<p>Also, understanding the stocks in the sector will help as well. Whether its news, earnings or some insider buying/selling, effects of other tickers can cause a move on the sector. So being aware of this when trading mid/large cap stocks will only benefit your odds.</p>
