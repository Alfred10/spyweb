					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					
					<p>In this section, I will be discussing the specifics of swing trades and how exactly to understand when a setup is a swing trade versus a day trade. I've found this a common misunderstanding amongst traders so that's why this will be a separate section in itself. I will also be providing some of my past swing trades to help put to life the concepts I'm explaining. There will also be a swing trading PDF that implements the techniques said into reality.</p>
					
				</div>
				
				<div>
					
					<h1>Key Levels</h1>
					
					<p>Just like trading penny stocks, key levels are one of the most important aspects of technical analysis. However, with swing trading, you want to focus on the MAJOR LEVELS. This is something I've found very significant with taking swing trades. The reason is that when you focus on every level, you tend to have a smaller trading window. I discussed the key levels in Chapter 2 so you can go back to see how to make off the key levels.</p>
					
					<p>The time frames I suggest using for swing trading is the hourly, 4hr, daily, and weekly. This will help to not cluster up the chart with many levels that might appear on smaller time frames. Below is an example of a key levels I've used in a recent swing trade of mine on $BYND.</p>
					
					<p>I understood the trend, the key levels and waited for the chart to show me an entry. So, I waited for the hold of the trend to see if the trendline was valid. As it held, I then waited for a key level to break to the upside and hold. At that point, I knew the chart was bullish as levels are breaking to the upside. I entered there and took some partial profits as we got to the next key level. I continued to hold until we reached the next key level where I flattened my position.</p>
					
					<p>Notice how I played the major trend line and entered as a key level broke and held to the upside. Also notice how I broke it down on 4hr time frame and I entered at this time frame. This is very important as I've seen that many traders execute on a different time frame that they analyze on. This is a very poor way as your executions are done on a seperate plan. Do this, and you will get stopped out on a lot of these trades.</p>

					<h1>Strength and Weakness</h1>
					
					<p>This is a very crucial concept that I've really developed and infused into my trading. This exposes the behavior of a stock that gives you the basic idea of whether a stock is weak or strong as well if it's a good buy, sell or hold. The PDF will be linked at the end of this chapter that instructs the ideas here into a basic tool to use.</p>
					
					<div>
						
						<h3><u>Strength:</u></h3>
						
						<p>If you are trying to buy a stock in hopes that it will go up, you want the stock to be strong. For a stock to be strong, it needs to be showing bullish signs. <b>Bullish signs</b> are signs of a stock, based on the chart, that gives upside signals. Bullish signs include key levels breaking to the upside and holding, increasing volume, supports holding and signs of an uptrend.</p>
						
						<p>However, there should be no entries, or at least full positions, taken at a bullish sign. Bullish confirmations include several bullish signs that appear on the chart. In trading, you want to get the most amount of odds in your favor. So, the more bullish signs you see, the higher chance your long position will work out. Below are examples of a bullish signs versus several bullish signs.</p>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section3/image1.png" alt = "swing trade bullish sign"></center>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section3/image2.png" alt = "swing trade bullish sign and bullish confirmation"></center>
						
						<p>The real problem with bullish signs versus confirmations is the patience factor. Just because a bullish sign appears, doesn't mean it won't go higher or a confirmation always going higher. It's all about getting the odds in your favor. So, there will be times when bullish signs have upside and you beat yourself up because you missed it.  But you're exposed to more risk there. Instead, wait for the bullish confirmation and your results will show.</p>
						
					</div>
					
					<div>
						
						<h3><u>Weakness:</u></h3>
						
						<p>When weakness is shown on a chart, long positions shouldn't be taken. If you are betting the stock will go lower, you will want to be looking for bearish signs. Bearish signs include; support breaks, Resistances rejecting, lower lows, lower highs, and lower resistances. These are the main signs you want to look for when looking for weakness.</p>
						
						<p>However, no short positions should be taken in full when there is bearish signs. Often, I will take around 10%-25% of my avg position size in a bearish sign, depending on the setup. So, if I stop out, I stop out 75%-90% less than if I got in full size. If is goes my way, then I've built myself a cushion of profit so when I do enter full size after more bearish signs appear, I have more risk I can take. Below is an example of a swing I took that shows the importance of adding.</p>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section3/image3.png" alt = "swing trade adding example"></center>
						
						<p>This was a penny stock that gapped up. These companies are usually not profitable so they move the stock up to raise money. Often, the stock will drop after the gap. So, I took this swing trade as a level rejected to the downside. However, the company released news the following days that pushed the stock back up. But, I've seen the news wasn't credible and during pre market, all of the gains were lost. Also, we put in a lower high form the prior gap up showing the chart is still bearish. As a result, I added as we popped up intra day creating a head and shoulders pattern,. I then covered at the next support lower at $2.00.</p>
						
						<p>Below is also a swing trade I took to the downside. There was an increasing trendline that failed to hold. We began to reject it as a resistance which is a bearish sign. I then took it short as a l=key level rejected. I continued to hold and then added as the next key level failed to hold. I took partials as the trend was still bearish and then flattened as we put in a higher low, which is a bullish sign.</p>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section3/image4.png" alt = "swing trade partials example"></center>
						
						<p>Cleary, signs of the stock being weak or strong is very crucial. It's a very simple concept but can begin to help your trading without making it too complicated.</p>

					<h1>Concepts</h1>
					
					<p>When swing trading, patience is a huge factor when still in the position. All swing trading resembles is day trading just with a longer duration. I'm sure you or someone you heard about, often takes swing trades but closes them out way too soon. This is something a lot of traders have a problem with, including myself. A helpful tip I like giving is not looking at the swing trade when its active. If not, you will begin to treat it as a day trade and watch the minor levels. This will likely cause you to get scared and exit out. Instead, when you enter, set price alerts as well with your stop loss and walk away.</p>
					
					<p>Notice how there isn't much difference with swing trading. Sticking to key levels and not worrying about anything else will really simplify your charts and help with understanding. No matter how we feel about the chart, it's imperative to just trade the chart. Understand the trend, wait for the confirmation to get full size into a position, and analyze the results. I went over that in the "Process" section.</p>
					
					<p>Risk management when in swing trades is very important as well. Making sure you are taking profits along the way and raising your stop loss is crucial. When you enter a trade, you are exposed to the most risk. So, if the trade is going in your favor, why keep that risk? Sell some at every key level and flatten the position when there is a reason to sell.</p>
