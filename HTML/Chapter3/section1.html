					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					
					<p>The difference between a mock trader and a real trader is their process. If you ask a beginner/mock trader to jot down their process, well they can't. The reason why is because they don't have a process. The majority of us have been in those general groups where a bunch of amateurs sway everyone's opinion. I do believe in the power in groups but you can't learn by being surrounded by traders on the same level as you.</p>

					<h1>Environment</h1>
					
					<p>Your environment, whether its trading or your daily life, has much more influence on you than you might think. That's why the first step to beginning a process is being surrounded by traders that actually know what they are talking about. But also knowing not to be swayed by your opinion being under theirs. Use the individuals around you as a learning tool and understand how they trade. You will begin to notice the areas you might need to improve on. They will also be an accountability factor when you trade. We all face greed and FOMO on a daily basis. An accountability trader will help keep you in line and help to not force those stupid trades. Additionally, knowing when to silent all talk is very important as well. I prefer to stay silent when I learned something new and/or fixed a problem in my process. This will leave you and only you to the charts; as well will accurately show whether you understood and made progress.</p>

					<h1>Monthly Goals/Daily Report Card</h1>
					
					<p>This is a concept that I didn't invent or create at all. This is a concept I learned from SMB Capital. Without a doubt, this has been a part of my recent success with trading. What this calls for is monthly goals for your trading. Whether it's getting better entries, exits, learning more about risk management, sizing up, sizing down and so on. This is a very important factor in your trading. This will continue to progress your trading and help maintain a "Growth Mindset", also a term from SMB. Without this, you will remain stagnate and will only be a matter of time before your trading goes downhill.</p>
					
					<p>Once you have this monthly goal set, create written documents of how to process in this area. For example, one of my goals these past few months was to size up. So my steps were, size up on confident setups, size down on less confident/potential setups, size up on setups I've often performed well in,  etc. This will help your goal become a reality and not just some words to make you feel you are making progress.</p>
					
					<p>Now these daily report cards, either at the end of the trading day or at the close, are very important. I suggest physically writing them out. They should include the following: the trades you took, the outcome, how much you stuck to your plan, your feelings for the day and how much you progressed to that monthly goal. Once you have these written down, grade yourself on your overall performance. Make a rubric, A-F and be honest with this. If you aren't honest, your only adding a barrier to the street.</p>
					
					<p>This is my rubric. Note, it will change depending on your trading style.</p>
					
					<ul>
						
						<li>A: Stuck to plan before the trade and execution was perfect, no outside manipulation.</li>
						<li>B: Stuck to most of my plan but emotions and/or outside manipulation took part.</li>
						<li>C: Stuck to some of my plan but the majority of my trades were controlled with emotions and/or outside influence.</li>
						<li>D: Barely stuck to my plan and the trade(s) were executed poorly with all influence of environment and not my thinking.</li>
						<li>F: Stuck to nothing I planned and traded with all greed, FOMO and others opinions.</li>
						
					</ul>

					<h1>Structure</h1>
					
					<p>Before any trade you take, you must have a structured plan of everything that led you to that thesis. As well as what steps you play to take while executing the trade. What this does is allow you to have a process to follow. By following this process, you will begin to finally be able to see what you need to improve on with your trading. Too many people trade blindly and just move on. If you want those results, then leave this page. If not, your here to learn the style of trading that will give access to a potentially greater trading future.</p>
					
					<p>Picture this plan as a foundation that your building. The more cracks/holes you find, the stronger the foundation will be when you fix it. With trading, the more weaknesses and downfalls you find, the more your plan will develop, similar to the foundation. In summary, create a plan, and follow it; it's that simple!</p>
					
					<p>Here is an example of a plan:</p>
					
					<ul>
						
						<li>Levels at...</li>
						<li>Fundamentals seen and understood.</li>
						<li>Past chart says...</li>
						<li>I would like to get in and out at...</li>
						<li>How I plan to manage risk...</li>
						
					</ul>
					
					<p>and so on. After this is done, you then go to your process and follow that accordingly! Examples of trading processes are in the next few sections.</p>

					<h1>Trading Your Edge</h1>
					
					<p>This is the last thing I would like to discuss for having a process. When trading, there at countless ideas and ways of taking trades with various reasonings. However, it's imperative that you find the strategy/setups that you are comfortable with.</p>
					
					<p>Trading with edge allows you to be on the right side of the odds as much as possible. Nothing with trading stocks will have a 100% likelihood. Instead, it's all about having the favorable sides of the odds. The only way to find your edge is to have a trading process. A set system of how you trade ranging from before, during and after the executions. When you do this, you will notice the setups that you perform the best in and that you perform poorly in. So, you  will have the ability to recognize these patterns and be able to size up accordingly.</p>
					
					<p>When you don't trade with edge, you are trading without the odds in your favor. This is clearly a very poor way of trading and will likely lead to an unsuccessful trading career. In summary, find within your trading where you perform best, and don't go out of those boundaries!</p>
