					<h1>Introduction</h1>
					
					<p>Penny stocks are often looked over when it comes to consistency. Many will just see the face value of them and compare it to casinos. However, that couldn't be further to the truth. Trading micro/small caps stocks requires a totally different approach, compared to mid/large caps trading. That is why this is going to be a seperate section in itself. All information, concepts and terminology will be discussed in this section. The plan and  the rulebook can be found in the pdf linked below.</p>

					<h1>Reasonings and News</h1>
					
					<p>There are thousands of small cap stocks but we only care about the ones that are in play; or as SMB calls them, "stocks in play."  There are many factors that go into trading penny stocks versus mid/large caps. One is the intra day moves they have. For penny stocks, you want to make sure they have an opportunity for profit with the least amount of risk. If you trade penny stocks that aren't in play, you will seem them as low volume, high spread charts. Spread is the difference between the ask and bid price. So the larger the spread, the more risk you face. Going back to chapter 1, you will see why trading low volume is difficult.</p>
					
					<p>So making sure the penny stocks you are trading on an intra day basis have credible news or a gap up, will be in your best interest. To find these, you can use a stock scanner either on youtube, or sites like finviz.com to find them. When you find the top movers of the day, you then use your criteria to filter the ones that are in line with your process. This is all trial and error but in the next few sections, I will show a few of aspects from my personal trading that I find success in. In short, only trade the penny stocks that are in play, and that show value and more opportunity than usual.</p>
					
					<p>Also, making sure the news is credible is very important as well. Simply check the news and see if its something traders/investors are interested in. Also, when these companies beat earnings, a run or move higher is often followed. It's all about trial and error; finding the exact types of news that drive your setup should be a priority.</p>

					<h1>Fundamentals</h1>
					
					<p>When trading stocks, penny stocks in particular, the majority of the trade is based on technical analysis. The minority goes into the fundamentals of the company that can help determine the direction of the chart for that day.</p>
					
					<p>The first aspect to look for is the supply and demand effect of the stock. It's simple economics, more supply of an item, decreases the prices, while a smaller supply of an item will increase the price. Compare the prices of diamonds to corn, you will see how simple this works. Same with stocks, the more supply of a stock, the more likely the price will decrease, generally. This is found as the float of the stocks, the number of shares actually available for trading. Micro floats are usually below 1 million shares and a low float is considered to be under 15 million shares. So if the float is low, it's easier for buyers to cover the float and push up the stock. If the float is high, there are more shares then demanded, so the chance for buyers to cover the float is much less.</p>
					
					<p>If the demand is high for a low/micro float, you will find it to be more volatile; more moves in less time. This is especially dangerous for short bias traders as it's easier to cover the whole float and more. Another dangerous part about micro floats and low float stocks is they tend to gap up a lot. This is one of the differences of small caps compared to large caps. Your stop loss needs to be very analyzed with stocks that have intra day gaps.</p>
					
					<p>Another aspect that is important with penny stocks is RVOL. This is the current volume compared to the average volume. For example, if RVOL is 1.5, then the stock is trading 1.5x greater than the average volume. So, for stocks in play, you would want the RVOL to be over 1 or even over 2. When trading penny stocks, from opportunity to protecting your backside, you would want volume to at least be above average.</p>
					
					<p>The last aspect I will discuss is the dilution effect of penny stocks. This is the ability for companies to sell more shares to the open public. When a company does this, going back to the supply and demand effect, they are increasing the supply. This will decrease the price and benefit shorts and not long bias traders. So to help prevent this, just make sure the companies your about to trade don't have this ability. Being stuck in an offering is one of the worst experiences you'll ever have, so let's not deal with that.</p>

					<h1>Technicals</h1>
					
					<p>This is going to be broken up into several sub sections due to the length of the information. But it all comes full circle and is relatively simple.</p>
					
					<div>
						
						<h3><u>Volume:</u></h3>
						
						<p>When trading small caps, the RVOL is very important, as we discussed earlier. On the chart, we will be looking at the VWAP. I discussed the VWAP in short in Chapter 1, so you should have a rough idea of what it represents. For penny stocks, the VWAP is very crucial. Longs should be taken above VWAP and shorts should be taken below VWAP. Stick to this rule and you will be covering risk your exposed to if you don't.</p>
						
						<p>Play the VWAP as a key level. Watch what the stock does at the VWAP. Does it give bullish signs or even a confirmation; or does it give bearish signs or even confirmation. In the strength versus weakness PDF, I go over what these concepts are. Through my experience, buying penny stocks at the open has too much risk exposure to take. Instead, wait for it to pullback to VWAP, which is almost always does, and see the reaction it has. If the first initial push has a pullback and that pullback is supported by VWAP or higher, it's more likely the stock will rise again. I'm played this setup so many times, and with other criteria as well, this has to be the most important.</p>
						
						<p>Note that penny stocks setups will often change. From when I first started trading them to now, the setups have changed. So, that's why it's so important to find the setups and wait for them. If there is no setup, or the penny stocks isn't doing what you expected, don't bother taking a trade. There will always be another opportunity.</p>
						
						<p>Below are examples of VWAP pullback entries.</p>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section2/image0.png" alt = "vwap pullback"></center>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section2/image1.png" alt = "vwap pullback"></center>
						
						<p>Seen in the previous section, RVOL and float is very closely related to volume, so making sure volume is high is very important. Seeing a stock over VWAP and holding levels, are a sign you want to be seeing for long biased trades. Volume has a huge relation to penny stocks to making sure its above average and trading above to VWAP is extremely important for long biased traders.</p>
						
					</div>
					
					<div>
						
						<h3>Key Levels:</h3>
						
						<p>I've discussed this in prior chapters and will continue to until the cows come home! If there is one thing you should understand about trading, it's the reaction to key levels. Even for penny stocks, the major levels are extremely crucial when trading them intra day.</p>
						
						<p>These key levels include, wicks, gap down lows, gap up highs, major resistance, major support, consolidations etc. If you mark these off, you will see how even on an intra day basis, these levels are true. Below is a chart of a penny stock gapper on the 11th of July.</p>
						
						<p>You will see the big picture charts, I marked off several key levels. Clearly, on the intra day chart, those levels were still active.</p>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section2/image2.png" alt = "penny stock big picture levels"></center>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section2/image3.png" alt = "penny stock levels"></center>
						
						<p>Marking these levels off is very simple but highly rewarding. Soley playing the reactions of these levels is a good way to trade itself. But, in trading, you want the most amount of odds in your favor. That's why you will then look at the other criteria as well to help get those odds.</p>
						
					</div>
					
					<div>
						
						<h3>Patterns:</h3>
						
						<p>I also discussed patterns in prior chapters. Patterns still appear with small caps, just don't base the whole trade on it. Basing a trade on a single pattern or one sign, only gives you the most risk exposure. Instead, understand a collaborative of signs and use them for a trade; patterns, levels, volume, past history, tape etc.</p>
						
						<p>The most common patterns with small caps are wedges,  double tops and double bottoms. These are seen very often but don't always go in the direction you want. So, seeing a wedge over VWAP hold versus under VWAP rejection, offers more chance of upside.</p>
						
						<p>Below is an example of a wedge pattern with bullish signs.</p>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section2/image4.png" alt = "penny stock bullish pattern"></center>
						
					</div>
					
					<div>
						
						<h3>Prior Day Runners:</h3>
						
						<p>Penny stock are usually terrible companies with bad fundamentals. So, they will often gap up their stock to raise money for whatever they choose. As a result, chances are, the penny stock you are watching has gapped up in its past chart. Study that chart, see what the pre market chart does. what are the levels? what does it do at the open? Does it usually close lower? If it does this, what does it usually do? All of these questions will only better your understanding of the trade. Not all gaps will be the same but you will see some similarities between them, whether its a common level or a common theme!</p>
						
						<p>Below is an example of how I used the past gap days to depict what will happen during the current day gap up.</p>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section2/image5.png" alt = "penny stock prior day gap"></center>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section2/image6.png" alt = "penny stock prior gap up premarket drops at open"></center>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section2/image7.png" alt = "penny stock prior gap up premarket drops at open"></center>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section2/image8.png" alt = "penny stock past day gap"></center>
						
						<center><img class = "responsiveImage" src = "../../IMG/Chapter3/Section2/image9.png" alt = "penny stock current day gap"></center>
						
						<p>Now that you understand the general idea of finding opportunity in penny stocks, it's all practice form here. Everything I've said was all learned from constant trading. Develop your own personal strategy for penny stocks and have a plan. An exact process of what your trade,  how to develop the trade, what to do during the trade, and to the result are all examples.</p>
						
						<p>What works for me and other traders, won't for you. So, it's important to see what you understand from this section, and combine them with concepts you trade by. Below are PDFs I've created that shows my trading process with penny stocks.</p>
